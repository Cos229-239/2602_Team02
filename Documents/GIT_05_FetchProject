GIT 05 — Using Your Personal Branch
Your personal branch was created earlier and will be used for the entire project.


Purpose

Now that the Build Master has created and uploaded the initial project, your job is to safely work on your own copy without breaking the team.
This is done by working on your personal branch, which already exists and will be used for the entire project.

A personal branch is:
	•	where you write code
	•	where you experiment
	•	where mistakes are allowed

You do not work directly on main or dev.

⸻

Prerequisites (Already Done — GIT 01 & GIT 02)

Before starting this step, the following should already be true:
	•	You have accepted the GitHub repo invite
	•	You have cloned the repo using GitHub Desktop (and pushed your read me change to create a branch)
	•	The Build Master has pushed a working project

If any of these are false, stop and fix them first.

⸻

Persistent Personal Branch Policy (This Course)

In this course, you will use one personal branch for the entire project.
	•	You do not create feature branches
	•	You do not recreate your personal branch weekly
	•	Your branch (named after you) is your permanent workspace

All work happens on your personal branch.
Merges into dev happen later, intentionally.

⸻

Step 1 — Open the Repo and Sync dev
This is the moment where you pull the actual project into your local machine for the first time.

Before working on your branch, make sure your local copy is up to date.
	1.	Open GitHub Desktop
	2.	Make sure the correct team repository is selected
	3.	In the Current Branch dropdown, select dev
	4.	Click Fetch origin
	5.	If updates are available, click Pull

Checkpoint:
	•	You are on the dev branch
	•	GitHub Desktop reports the branch is up to date
	•	You can see the full project created by the Build Master


Do not continue unless all three are true.


Step 1.5 — Verify the Project Runs

Before switching branches or making any changes, confirm the project works on your machine.
	1.	Open the project in Android Studio
	2.	Allow Gradle to finish syncing
	3.	Run the app using the emulator or a physical device
	4.	Confirm the app launches without errors

Checkpoint:
	•	The app builds successfully
	•	No red Gradle errors are present
	•	You can see the app running

If the project does not run:
	•	Do not create or switch branches
	•	Do not commit anything
	•	Post in your team Discord channel and tag the Build Master

Fixing setup issues comes before all other work.

Step 2 — Switch to (or Create) Your Personal Branch

In most cases, your personal branch already exists.

If your personal branch already exists:
	1.	Open the Current Branch dropdown
	2.	Select your branch (named after you, all lowercase)
	3.	Confirm it switches successfully

You are now working on your personal branch.

If you do NOT see a personal branch with your name:

STOP.

Do not create a new branch here.

Return to **GIT_01 — Git Setup & Branch Creation** and complete that step fully.
Once your personal branch exists and is visible on GitHub, return here and continue.


Step 2.5 — Bring the Project into Your Personal Branch

Now that you have confirmed the project works on dev, you need to bring it into your personal branch so you can begin working.
	1.	In GitHub Desktop, switch to your personal branch
	2.	If prompted with a message about changes from dev, choose
		“Bring my changes into this branch”
	3.	If no prompt appears, use:
	•	Branch → Merge into current branch
	•	Select dev
	4.	Complete the merge

Checkpoint:
	•	Your personal branch now contains the full project
	•	No files disappear when switching branches
	•	GitHub Desktop shows no errors

At this point, your personal branch is fully synced and ready for work.

⸻

Step 3 — Push Your Personal Branch to GitHub

After merging dev into your personal branch, your branch has changed locally.
You must now upload those changes to GitHub (the remote version of personal - think of it as a backup copy).
	1.	In GitHub Desktop, confirm you are on your personal branch
	2.	Click Push origin

If you instead see Publish branch, click it — this means your branch has not yet been created on GitHub.

Checkpoint:
	•	Open the repository on GitHub in a browser
	•	Switch to your personal branch using the branch dropdown
	•	You should see the full project files there

DONE!

If the files are missing or the branch does not appear, stop and ask for help.

General Rules:

Confirm You Are Working Safely

Before doing any real work, verify:
	•	You are on your personal branch
	•	main and dev remain untouched
	•	Any changes you make stay isolated

This is your safe workspace for the rest of the project.

Important:
	•	You never work directly on main
	•	You never experiment on dev
	•	You always commit to your personal branch
	•	Merging into dev happens later and only when instructed

Breaking these rules can affect the entire team.

⸻

Why This Matters

Personal branches:
	•	protect the project
	•	prevent conflicts
	•	preserve accountability
	•	provide a complete work history

This is not extra work.
This is how real teams operate.

⸻

What’s Next

Once your personal branch is confirmed and published:
	•	Begin working only on your branch
	•	Follow assignment instructions for commits
	•	Later, you will merge from your branch into dev

Do not merge anything for a while (only push to your personal branch) unless explicitly instructed or you know what you are doing. 
Merging UP (to dev or main) is a group effort, and you need a "Build Buddy" for that.
