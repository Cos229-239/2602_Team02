Trello — Setup & Board Usage Walkthrough

Purpose

  Trello is used to track the project's visible work, progress, and next steps.
  
  Trello is lightweight and focused on:
  	•	confirming setup is complete
  	•	establishing the habit of tracking work
  	•	preparing for a workflow
  
  This is not a full Agile sprint yet.

⸻

Step 1 — Locate and Join the Board
	•	Use the Trello board link provided during setup
	•	The board link will be posted under your named setup thread
	•	Confirm you can see the following lists (names may vary slightly):
	•	Backlog / To Do
	•	In Progress
	•	Waiting for Review
	•	Completed / Done

If you can't see the board, please resolve this as soon as possible.

Step 2 — Add Cards 

You must add cards representing actual work you have already completed (for this tutorial).

Rules
	•	Each card represents one tangible accomplishment
	•	Place cards under **Completed or In Progress**
	•	Do not add cards for work you have not done

⸻

Required Cards (Use This Format)

Card 1 — Android Studio Installed

Description
	•	Installed latest Android Studio
	•	SDK configured
	•	Emulator or physical device verified

⸻

Card 2 — GitHub Repo Connected

Description
	•	Cloned the assigned team repository
	•	Android project created and pushed by Build Master
	•	Repo opens correctly in Android Studio

⸻

Card 3 — Jetpack Compose Project

Description
	•	Empty Compose Activity
	•	Kotlin only (no XML layouts)
	•	“Hello World” runs successfully

⸻

Do NOT add Firebase cards unless explicitly instructed for this week.

⸻

Card Formatting Expectations
	•	Clear, short descriptions
	•	One task per card
	•	Use labels such as:
	•	Setup
	•	Infrastructure
	•	Week 01

Optional (Recommended)
	•	Attach a screenshot:
	•	Android Studio running
	•	GitHub repo visible
	•	Emulator showing “Hello World”

Screenshots help with grading and verification.

⸻

Step 3 — Add ONE Card for Next Week (Preparation Only)

Under Backlog / To Do, add one preparation card.

Card Title

Create Personal Branch (Week 2 Setup)

Description
	•	Create a new branch from main
	•	Name the branch with your first name (e.g., patrick)
	•	This branch will be your working branch starting Week 02
	•	Push the branch to GitHub and verify it appears online

Leave this card in Backlog for now

⸻

Important Notes
	•	Trello is graded on presence and accuracy, not volume
	•	Do not fabricate or inflate cards
	•	Trello reflects reality — it does not replace doing the work
	•	More structure and stricter expectations begin in later weeks
