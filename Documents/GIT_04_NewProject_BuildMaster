Build Master Instructions

Congratulations (for better or worse), you are responsible for creating the initial Android project and publishing the baseline repository that the rest of your team will build from.
As the build master, should you choose to accept this role, you will be merging work from Dev to Main (later in the month). 



⚠️ REQUIRED BEFORE CONTINUING

This step assumes you are already comfortable running command-line (CLI) commands
to create and manage projects.

If you are unsure **why** we use the terminal (even inside VS Code), **where** commands
run, or **which tool actually creates a project**, you must read this first:

**CLI vs IDE: How Projects Are Created**

If you already understand this model, continue below.




For now, we will just upload the project. 
This is a one-time setup task. Do it carefully.

We will be using Android Studio for the walkthrough, but it's the same for any project/IDE.

Your Responsibility (Read This First)

You are not setting up Git rules.
You don't need to worry about the IGNORE file. 

You are creating a clean, working Android project and pushing it so everyone else can begin.
Everyone’s work depends on this step (GIT_04_NewProject).

Step-by-Step Instructions

Clone the Team Repository (if you haven't)
	•	Use GitHub Desktop
	•	Clone the assigned team repository
	•	Choose a clear local location (e.g., Projects/TeamName)

Do not create any Android (or IDE-based) project yet.

⸻

Create the Android Project inside your local team Repo Folder 
	•	Open Android Studio
	•	Choose New Project
	•	When asked for the project location:
	•	Select the cloned GitHub repo folder
	•	Do not create it somewhere else and move it later

NOTE: 
	•	The Android project must live inside the repo folder, or GitHub Desktop will not see it.
	•	You are making a project in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose
	•	Kotlin only, no XML

⸻

Let Android Studio Finish Setup
	•	Allow Gradle to sync
	•	Run the app once
	•	Confirm it builds and launches

Notes:
	•	At this stage, you are not expected to understand Jetpack Compose — only to confirm the project runs.
	•	Fix obvious setup issues before committing.

⸻

Commit the Project Using GitHub Desktop
	•	Open GitHub Desktop
	•	You should see many new files listed
	•	Commit with a clear message, for example:
      "Initial Android project scaffold"

Do not commit from inside Android Studio.

⸻

Push the Project to GitHub
	•	Push the commit to the shared repo
	•	Use the correct branch as instructed (personal AND dev this time)
	•	Confirm the push succeeds

⸻

Notify the Team

Once the push is complete:
	•	Post in your team Discord channel
	•	Let everyone know the repo is ready to clone and branch from

⸻

Important Rules
	•	Only one person creates the Android project
	•	Do not remove or modify .gitignore
	•	Do not restructure folders unless instructed
	•	Do not use GitHub login inside Android Studio
	•	Git actions are handled through GitHub Desktop
