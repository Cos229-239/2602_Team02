First Git Task: Claim Your Branch

Before doing any real project work, you will complete a simple verification task to confirm your Git setup is correct.

This task ensures you can:
	•	edit a file
	•	commit changes
	•	push to GitHub
	•	work in your personal branch

⸻

What to Do
	1.	Make sure you are on your personal branch
      (it should have your name on it - if not, read git-setup)
	2.	Open the project’s README.md (at the root level under "code") file
	3.	Add your name to the section labeled something like:
      ## Team Members
        - Patrick J Kelly

	4.	Save the file

⸻

Commit and Push
	1.	Return to GitHub Desktop
	2.	Confirm the README change is detected
	3.	Enter a commit message like:
      Add Patrick J Kelly to README
	4.	Click Commit to your branch (blue button on bottom left)
	5.	Click Push origin
  
DONE!

⸻

Important Rules
	•	This change stays in your personal branch
	•	Do not merge this into dev (yet)
	•	Do not push directly to main
	•	Do not edit other people’s names

This task is about proving your setup, not changing the shared project.

⸻

What This Proves

By completing this task, you demonstrate that:
	•	your repo is cloned correctly
	•	your branch is set up correctly
	•	you can safely push changes
	•	GitHub Desktop is working

This prevents much bigger problems later.

If something goes wrong here:
	•	nothing important is broken
	•	it’s easy to fix
	•	the instructor can help quickly
