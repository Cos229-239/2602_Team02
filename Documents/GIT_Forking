# Forking: What It Is, Why It Exists, and When to Use It

## What Is Forking?

**Forking** is when you create your *own copy* of someone else’s GitHub repository **under your own GitHub account**.

- The original repo stays exactly as it is
- Your fork is a completely separate repository
- You can push, break, experiment, or abandon your fork without affecting the original

A fork is **not** a branch.
A fork is **not** a clone.
A fork is a *new repository* that started life as a copy of another one.

## Why Forking Exists

Forking exists to solve one core problem:

> “I want to work with this code, but I do NOT have permission to push to it.”

Common reasons:
- Open-source contribution
- Learning from an example project
- Experimenting without risk
- Proposing changes back to the original author

Forking gives you **ownership** of your copy.

## Forking vs Branching (Important)

| Concept  | What It Is                       | Who Owns It  |
|------    |-----------                       |------------  |
| Branch   | A variation inside the same repo | Shared |
| Fork     | A completely new repo | You |
| Clone    | A local copy of a repo | Local only |

In **this class**:
- You use **branches** for teamwork
- You **do NOT use forks** for team projects
- You fork at the very end of COS229 to back up the entire project and preserve it

## Why We Do NOT Use Forking for Team Projects

Forking is the **wrong tool** for collaborative class work because:

- Everyone ends up in separate repos
- Merging becomes confusing and error-prone
- There is no single source of truth
- Instructors cannot easily review progress

For team projects:
- You are **invited** to a shared repo
- Everyone works on branches
- Changes flow upward (personal → dev → main)

No forks required.

## When Forking *Is* Appropriate

Forking *is* appropriate when:

- You are backing something up
- You are exploring an example repo
- You are learning a new framework
- You want to experiment freely
- You are contributing to open source
- You do not have push access

Examples:
- “Let me try modifying this Compose sample”
- “I want to learn how this Firebase setup works”
- “I want to submit a pull request to an open-source project”

## How to Fork a Repository (GitHub)

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click **Fork** (top-right)
3. Choose your GitHub account
4. GitHub creates a new repo under your name

You now own that repo.

From there:
- Clone **your fork**
- Make changes
- Optionally submit a **Pull Request** back to the original

## Key Takeaways

- Forking = new repo, new ownership
- Branching = shared repo, shared workflow
- Forking is for **permission boundaries**
- Branching is for **team collaboration**
- This class uses **branches, not forks**

If you are unsure whether to fork or branch:
**Ask first. Forking is rarely, if ever, the correct choice in this course.**
