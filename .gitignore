# .gitignore 
#
# AUTHOR: Patrick J. Kelly
# DATE: Dec 2025
#
# PURPOSE:
# This file tells Git what NOT to upload to GitHub.
#
# IMPORTANT RULE (READ THIS FIRST):
# - If YOU did not type it yourself, it probably does not belong in Git.
# - Your computer creates LOTS of files automatically.
# - Those files stay on your machine but will mess up other people.
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE - when starting a new repo of your own:
# 1. COPY this file locally
# 2. Push it to the root of your repo as: .gitignore
# 3. COMMIT this file BEFORE writing any code
#
# NOTE:
# This file is intentionally VERY broad.
# Ignoring extra things is safe.
# Uploading junk is NOT.

# IMPORTANT FOR BEGINNERS (READ THIS)
#
# You are NOT expected to know:
# - which files your computer creates
# - which folders are build output
# - which files are safe to push
#
# You do NOT need to look through your folders.
# You do NOT need to decide what belongs in Git.
#
# This file already made those decisions FOR YOU.
#
# Pushing your source code and how this file helps:
#   If YOU wrote it, Git keeps it.
#   If your COMPUTER made it, Git ignores it.
#
# If Git allows the file to be committed, its probably safe.
# If Git blocks the file, it was never meant to be shared (somebody blocked it)

# First batch of files
# OS / EDITOR JUNK
#
# These files are created automatically by your OPERATING SYSTEM
# or CODE EDITOR. They are machine-specific and useless to teammates.
#
# macOS creates:
#   .DS_Store       → Finder folder metadata
#
# Windows creates:
#   Thumbs.db       → Image thumbnails
#   desktop.ini    → Folder display settings
#
# VS Code creates:
#   .vscode/        → Local editor preferences (not team logic)
#
# So we block these files from being uploaded with the followin lines:
###############################################################################

.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

.vscode/*
!.vscode/settings.json
!.vscode/extensions.json

.idea/

###############################################################################
# LOGS / TEMP FILES
#
# These files are created AUTOMATICALLY while programs are RUNNING.
# You did NOT write these files — your computer did.
#
# What are they?
# - .log files   → Records of program activity, errors, or crashes
# - .tmp / .temp → Temporary working files created during execution
# - .swp         → Editor recovery files (in case your editor crashes)
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They change constantly
# - They are different on every machine
# - They are NOT part of your project’s logic
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit files with these extensions
###############################################################################

*.log
*.tmp
*.temp
*.swp

###############################################################################
# NODE / WEB PROJECTS
#
# These files are created AUTOMATICALLY by JavaScript tools
# such as Node, npm, yarn, Vite, React, etc.
#
# You did NOT write these files — your tools downloaded or generated them.
#
# What are they?
# - node_modules/ → Downloaded libraries (can be thousands of files)
# - dist/ build/ out/ → Compiled output generated from your source code
# - npm/yarn logs → Error reports created when installs fail
# - .env files → Secrets and local machine configuration
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They can ALWAYS be regenerated
# - They are different on every machine
# - .env files contain PRIVATE keys and passwords
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit dependencies, build output, or .env files

###############################################################################
# PYTHON PROJECTS
#
# Python creates files AUTOMATICALLY while your code is running.
# You did NOT write these files — Python generated them for speed.
#
# What are they?
# - __pycache__/ → Cached compiled Python code
# - *.pyc       → Compiled bytecode versions of your .py files
# - Virtual envs → Local copies of Python and libraries
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They are rebuilt automatically
# - They are different on every machine
# - Virtual environments contain absolute local paths
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit Python caches or virtual environments

###############################################################################
# JAVA / ANDROID PROJECTS
#
# Java and Android build tools generate files AUTOMATICALLY.
# You did NOT write these files — the build system did.
#
# What are they?
# - .gradle/      → Local Gradle cache (downloaded + computed files)
# - build/        → Compiled output created from your source code
# - .externalNativeBuild/ → Native build output (Android)
# - .cxx/         → C++ build intermediates (Android NDK)
# - *.apk / *.aab → Compiled Android app packages
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They are large and machine-specific
# - They can ALWAYS be regenerated from source code
# - Uploading them causes merge conflicts and broken builds
#
# IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
# - ".gradle/"  → CACHE (IGNORE THIS)
# - "gradle/"   → WRAPPER (KEEP THIS)
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit build output or Gradle cache files
###############################################################################

###############################################################################
# FIREBASE (CONFIG + SECRETS)
#
# Firebase generates configuration and credential files AUTOMATICALLY.
# You did NOT write these files — Firebase did.
#
# What are they?
# - google-services.json     → Android app → Firebase project mapping
# - serviceAccountKey.json  → Admin / server credentials
# - firebase-adminsdk*.json → Backend service keys
# - firebase-debug.log      → Runtime debug output
# - firestore-debug.log     → Database debug output
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They contain PRIVATE API KEYS and credentials
# - They identify YOUR Firebase project and account
# - Every developer has DIFFERENT versions of these files
#
# What happens if you commit them:
# - Your keys become public - and people can do very strange things (as you)
# - Anyone can access or damage your backend
# - The project is permanently compromised
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - These files are NOT source code
# - They are ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC
# - Firebase regenerates them when you connect a project
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit Firebase config, credentials, or debug logs

###############################################################################
# OS BUILD ARTIFACTS
#
# These files are generated AUTOMATICALLY by your OPERATING SYSTEM
# during compilation, debugging, or execution.
#
# You did NOT write these files — your OS or compiler did.
#
# What are they?
# - *.dSYM → macOS debug symbol bundles (used for crash reports)
# - *.exe  → Windows compiled executables
# - *.dll  → Windows dynamic libraries created at build time
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They are PLATFORM-SPECIFIC (Mac vs Windows)
# - They are generated FROM your source code
# - They cannot be shared safely across machines
#
# Important concept:
# - Source code = what humans write
# - Build artifacts = what machines produce
#
# If the file only exists AFTER you click "Run" or "Build",
# it does NOT belong in Git.
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit OS-generated build artifacts
###############################################################################

*.dSYM
*.exe
*.dll


###############################################################################
# ARCHIVES / COMPRESSED FILES
#
# These files are COMPRESSED bundles of other files.
# They are usually created to MOVE or STORE files — not to build software.
#
# You did NOT write these files — a compression tool created them.
#
# What are they?
# - *.zip     → Common compressed archive (Windows / macOS)
# - *.tar     → Unix archive format
# - *.tar.gz  → Compressed tar archive (Linux / macOS)
# - *.rar     → Proprietary compressed archive
# - *.7z      → High-compression archive format
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They hide many files inside one file (Git can’t diff them)
# - They duplicate content already tracked in the repo
# - They cause huge repository size bloat
#
# Important rule:
# - GitHub is for SOURCE FILES
# - Archives are for DELIVERY or BACKUP, not collaboration
#
# If you need to share a compiled build or large bundle:
# - Use GitHub Releases
# - Or external storage (Google Drive, SSD, etc.)
#
# RULE:
# NEVER commit compressed archive files
###############################################################################

*.zip
*.tar
*.tar.gz
*.rar
*.7z


###############################################################################
# GITHUB / CI (CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION)
#
# CI systems (like GitHub Actions) run AUTOMATICALLY on servers.
# While they run, they may generate temporary logs or runtime files.
#
# What are these?
# - Workflow log files created during CI execution
# - Temporary artifacts produced while a job is running
#
# Why we ignore them:
# - They are NOT source code
# - They are recreated every time CI runs
# - GitHub already stores CI logs internally
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Workflow DEFINITION files (*.yml) MUST be committed
# - Workflow OUTPUT files (*.log) must NEVER be committed
#
# RULE:
# Commit workflows, NOT workflow output

# KEEP RULES (IMPORTANT)

# These rules PREVENT over-ignoring.
# Without these, students accidentally block real files.

# OTHER STUFF
# README.md - The main read‑me for your project. It tells teammates and graders what it is and how to run it, so always commit it.
# docs/**  - Documentation: markdown, diagrams, assignment notes, etc. These are written and should be shared.
# .github/workflows/*.yml - GitHub Actions workflows. They are automated tools for your project should you have any.
